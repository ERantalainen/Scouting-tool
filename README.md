# Scouting tool

In order to speed up my own workflow when scouting enemy teams, I originally created a CLI based tool to track enemy comps and display stats. 
However, I quickly realised it was very unapproachable for the vast majority of other coaches/analysts in the scene who needed such a tool.
So, this is Scouting-Tool 2.0 now with a GUI powered by QT.

## Features

- Save Teams, and automatically load previous teams whenever the program is opened.
- Add comps, add as many team comps as you wish, including map selection.
- Edit comps, quickly fix errors, or adjust data as the meta shifts.
- View stats, view overall stats, or go in depth and select a specific map to dive into.

## PLANNED

### Visual overhaul
-> More colors
-> Hero portraits

### More data
-> Ban tracking support
-> Optional notes

### Community requests
-> Few items requested by other coaches, and analysts I plan to implement, secret for now.
